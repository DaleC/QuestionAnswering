# Question Answering System for Factoid Questions
This project implements a question answering system that aims to answers
factoid questions and return answers if any from a given set of documents.

The system employs a web search engine to look for answers from a wider range
and possibly better set of documents, then projects those answers onto the
given set of documents to come up with final result.
